# PyTorch Basics to Advanced

Jupyter notebooks for PyTorch course, covering fundamentals through advanced topics.

---

##  Overview

This repository contains a series of notebooks that walk through PyTorch concepts step by step, from the basics to more advanced topics like model deployment, experiment tracking, transfer learning, and replicating research papers.

Each notebook is intended to be standalone and incremental, so you can run them in sequence or pick the ones youâ€™re interested in.

## Run in Google Colab

You donâ€™t need to set up a local environment â€” these notebooks were originally developed on **Google Colab**.  

To open any notebook in Colab:
1. Click the notebook file in this repo.  
2. Replace the `github.com` part of the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github`.  

Example:  
- GitHub URL â†’ `https://github.com/JaisalJain/pytorch-from-basics-to-advanced/blob/main/00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb`  
- Colab URL â†’ `https://colab.research.google.com/github/JaisalJain/pytorch-from-basics-to-advanced/blob/main/00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb`
